#include <unistd.h>

void	ft_putnnbrvoid ft_putnbr(int nb)
{
	
}

The idea, take a 2-digit number, 69 for example
first statement should write 6 by calculating 69 / 10.
second statement should write 9 by writing the remainder of 69 /10.
	First statement gives 6; seccond statement gives 9; results in an output
 of 69!
